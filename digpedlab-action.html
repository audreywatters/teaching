<h2>Digital Pedagogy Lab Summer Institute 2016: Action</h2>
<br />
<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>

<p>To explore the politics of the digital and to consider what &#8220;action&#8221; looks like with and through digital technologies</p>

<p>To challenge dualisms &#8211; thought/action, thinking/building, making//writing, digital/analog, public/private, action/inaction, &#8220;real world&#8221;/classroom &#8211; that permeate our cultural expectations of (digital) scholarship, (digital) pedagogy, and (digital) activism.</p>

<p>To ask what role &#8220;education&#8221; might play in critical/digital engagement.</p>

<p>To become more comfortable with constructing and deconstructing &#8220;ed-tech&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Questions and Provocations:</strong></p>

<p>How do we privilege &#8220;action&#8221;? How do we privilege &#8220;technological expertise&#8221; and/as action? What types of actions &#8220;count&#8221;?</p>

<p>Many of the topics for this track involve exploring various digital technologies, but the track assumes that participants have <u>zero background or previous experience</u> working with them. Indeed, one of the areas this class will repeatedly explore is how our ability to &#8220;take action&#8221; or even &#8220;see action&#8221; might change depending on our familiarity, expertise, and/or reluctance to use certain tools. The point of introducing and playing with these various technologies is not mastery; rather it&#8217;s to think critically about what actions they afford and what they constrain &#8211; in the classroom and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;What Will Start Taking Shape By Friday&#8221; Project:</strong></p>

<p>Participants should plan begin work on a project that would extend academic work beyond the research journal and/or beyond the classroom. Participants will present their works-in-progress to their cohort for feedback.</p>
